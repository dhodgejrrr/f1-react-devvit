# F1 Start Challenge - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The F1 Start Challenge is a polished, bite-sized reaction time game for Reddit's Developer Platform built with Devvit Web. The game challenges redditors to test their reflexes against the iconic Formula 1 five-light starting sequence, competing on persistent leaderboards and challenging friends in deterministic head-to-head races. The project is strategically designed to compete for top honors in the **Community Play** and **Best Kiro Developer Experience** categories of the Reddit & Kiro Hackathon.

This game faithfully recreates the visual aesthetic of Namco's 1982 _Pole Position_ while leveraging modern platform capabilities for viral community engagement. The core differentiator is perfect execution of a simple concept‚Äîflawless polish, authentic aesthetics, and innovative pseudo-synchronous multiplayer within platform constraints.
